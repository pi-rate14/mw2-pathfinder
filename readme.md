I was playing the new Call of Duty game and in it there is a system of weapon progression where you unlock new weapons and attachments for the weapons as you level up. However, unlocking one item needs you to reach a certain level with another item and that item requires a certain level for another item and so on. It is a tedious process to find the whole progression path for one item in order to enjoy the game.
I realised that this boils down to a Graph problem and therefore created a small project that shows the user the entire progression path for any item in the game.
